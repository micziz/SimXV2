## Contributing

PRs are greatly appreciated! You can open a PR if you want to:

- Fix a spelling error
- Fix a bug
- Fix a minor thing
- Fix documentation (such as this file) issues

If you want to propose a major refactor, or addition that I did not propose, please open an issue!

## Repository Guide

In the root of the repository there is a readme.md file, LICENSE, and requirements.txt, to install packages.

There are two folders. 

**SRC**: The source folder contains the source files, and tips and jobs text files. These are for the main file and should not be modified.

**DOC**: Contains the official documents for this project, like this one. Please do not edit this file or any other files in this folder unless prior ok.
