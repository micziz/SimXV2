## Going trough the repo

In the root of the repository there is a readme.md file, LICENSE and requirements.txt, to install packages.

There are two folders. 

**SRC**: The source folder contains the source files, and tips and jobs text files. These are for the main file and shloud not be modified.

**DOC**: Contains the official documents for this project, like this one. Please do not edit this file or any other files in this folder unless prior ok.

Help people with issues and comment on PR's.

## What to do
