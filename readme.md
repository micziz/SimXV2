## What is SimX?

SimX, witch stands for Simulation eXtreme (i know, not really extreme but it's my game and i make the rules...) is a real-ish simulator of life. It's currently in stages of development, but you would help out a ton if you helped the project, and gave me a help with contributions...

### Can i contribute?

## Compatibility.

The app was developed in python 3.10.2, the latest at this time. The app is compatible with all versions of python after 3.6, because of f strings. Better with 3.9.8 and above.

### Why?

Python 3.6 breaks compatibility from python 3.5 and before, because of it's introduction of f string that help string interpolation.
